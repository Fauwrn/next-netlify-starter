    <h1>Fraser Scowen</h1>
    <p>Fraser Scowen is an instrument maker and sound artist based in South East London. His
practices focuses on the creation of unique electronic instruments, emphasising an
expanded approach to sound synthesis through the exploration of materials,
experimental circuitry, time based processes and esoteric interfaces. These instrument
works encompass gallery pieces, live performance and recordings. Under the moniker
Maison Phantasy he is currently developing a range of experimental electronic
instruments.

    <h1>Lynxie Who</h1>
    <p>Lynxie Who is the solo project of Polish sound artist Rysia Anna Kaczmar, currently
based in London. Rooted in the fringes of noise, experimental sound design, and tactile
electronics, her performances explore the limits of voice, distortion, and handmade
circuitry. Blending DIY electronics, circuit-bent toys, and raw vocal manipulations, Lynxie
crafts soundscapes that buzz, rupture, and pulse with visceral intensity.
Her work investigates themes of identity, memory, folklore, and psychological
fragmentation - often drawing from personal and collective experiences. Through
saturated soundscapes and abrasive textures, Lynxie Who navigates the unstable spaces
between catharsis and chaos. Performance, ritual, and glitch become tools for both
disruption and healing. Operating at the intersection of the intimate and the volatile, she
invites listeners into a visceral experience - where softness distorts, noise becomes a
story, and emotion is not just expressed, but embodied.

    <h1>TROJANOVSKX</h1>
    <p>TROJANOVSKX is a London-based artist whose work explores the philosophical concept
of duality, deconstructing its structures through the intersection of sound, light,
movement, and technology. Their practice challenges the causality between movement
and sound while examining the evolving relationship between the human body and
machines. By employing cybernetic micro-systems, e-textiles, motion sensors, and digital
interfaces, they craft immersive, interactive experiences that blur the boundaries
between artist, artwork, and audience. Over the past year and a half, their practice has
expanded to incorporate motion capture interfaces and spatial sound installations,
transforming body movement into real-time audio-visual compositions. By integrating
motion sensors and digital control systems, they create responsive environments where
human presence shapes sound and light patterns. Their performances often evoke
ritualistic atmospheres with non-linear rhythmic structures. Recently, their work has
ventured into cyberpunk aesthetics to explore the decomposition of identity, reflecting
on how technology mediates physical presence and movement. This inquiry challenges
the boundaries between human agency and machine autonomy, inviting audiences to
question the role of technology in shaping modern embodiment. Recurring themes in
TROJANOVSKX’s work include identity, abstraction, geometry, and spirituality. Through
experimental soundscapes, bodily noise, and abstract visuals, they investigate the
dynamic interplay between technology and the human form, fostering immersive, multi-
sensory experiences that provoke shifting perceptions of presence and embodiment.

    <h1>Lucas Yoshimura Wood</h1>
    <p>Lucas Yoshimura Wood, born in London and half Japanese, thinks about and makes noise.
They perform playing with no input and feedback techniques as well as creating
installations exploring the relationship between noise and light/moving image. They use
improvisation and lofi recording in their work to evoke themes centred around time,
memory, light and dreams.
In this performance they present se-mi an immersive embodied improvisation with the
space. In the dark, using handmade light sensitive circuits and various light sources they
aim to create an artificial insect soundscape. Light, motion, space becoming modes for
connectivity in an almost guided listening.

    <h1>my grey leaving</h1>
    <p>‘my grey leaving’ is the solo project of Benjamin Thorn, creating blurry ambient-shoegaze
through improvisation with guitar, diy software effects, and field recordings. Through
exploring the aesthetics of ambivalence and ambiguity, their music shifts from distorted
walls of sound to quiet loops that faintly wither. Their music is available to listen on
Bandcamp, Nina, and other streaming platforms.

    <h1>Miles Lukoszevieze</h1>
    <p>Miles Lukoszevieze is a sound artist, composer and improviser residing in London. His
work spans the rich tapestries of noise, electroacoustic, experimental rock and
improvisation, realised through various monikers including the visceral noise rock band
Red Mar (est.2018) and post-industrial outfit Vostok (est.2020), as well as collaborative
projects with artists such as Graeme Smith, That Travis, Henry Cyer, Harry Fisher, Mai
Nguyen-Tri and more. His solo work realises a distinct intimacy of fragmented narratives
and emotive dichotomies, where disparate threads weave a soundscape of timbral
ambiguity, noise, colour, and abstraction.

blends ambient textures with elements of traditional Chinese culture. Her live
performances often incorporate randomness and audience interaction, creating unique
and unrepeatable soundscapes that explore the dynamic relationships between sound,
body, and space.
