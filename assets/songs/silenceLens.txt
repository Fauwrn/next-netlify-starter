silence:lens

it just feels like such a long time
to sit blankly at a wall and simply stare,
idly waiting for a moment 
- a fleeting chance of something
that we might share
and i try to find some meaning in the words of others
- but its never quite the same.
and i try to find another reason,
same old lens, a different frame

all this time ive spent going nowhere - and feel afraid
all this time ive spent going nowhere - and still feel the same

and all this time ive spent not going anywhere at all
