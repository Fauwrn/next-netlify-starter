old notes, new notes

so it all feels the same again
you thought that maybe this time youd get used to it
or i dont know
just kinda maybe the idea that for once things would change
and you wouldnt have to think about that anymore but
i think that you maybe just get trapped in the same thoughts
i guess its just a period of waiting for your head to kinda sort things out
couldnt really tell if it feels any better or if its just more of the same thing
or really what it feels like to feel better in the first place
so you can look through your old notes and write some new ones
and see i guess if your thoughts have changed
but generally they havent, generally theyre just the same thing
and its just waiting for that same thing to happen again and again and again and
i guess thats kinda just how it works until it wont one day and then i guess things will be slighty better
will just have to wait till then
will just have to wait till things change, or your head changes or you get help or i dont know

and then come back to that another
