labyrinth

this string has led me
led me down this path
- these bricked walls
i know i must go
down your labyrinth dream
this endless stream
i know

in dying light
you lead me down your candle lit path
into a field of burning
burning hay standing
broken, cut, clean
and though i wear down,
i know iâ€™ll make it in the end

this thread a dream, unseen
your forest trees stand over me
and i fall in the outcropping
with owls hooting down at me
