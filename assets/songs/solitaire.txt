solitaire

i have waited my whole life for you
i have waited my whole life for you
to come my way,
i have waited my whole life for you
and now you push me away
i have waited my whole life for you
and i cant find the words to say
the way you mean to me,
its only fair i see,
that just so easily,
you seem to tear me to shreds
i have waited my whole life for you,
i have waited my whole life for you
to lead me to rest
i have waited my whole life for you,
i have waited my whole life for you
to leave me to rest
