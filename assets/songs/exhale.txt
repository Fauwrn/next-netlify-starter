exhale

lately ive been feeling insecure,
seems to occur this time of year
- just like before -
and i should have spoke more of my heart
when id drunk to much last night
and hopee forgiveness - feigned attachment - just this once.

but instead i rambled on about my fears,
and you investigated me in search of tears,
when all i wanted was to confess and be sincere,
and tell you how i really feel when we are near.

i won’t try to change your mind
but every time I see you
feels like it’s the last time we will speak,
- at least like this -
soon ill take the train home,
pack my bags with all my things
- ill bring my worries with me -
memories of your face that slowly fade into my exile,
and soft kisses in dreams
and breathing exhale
