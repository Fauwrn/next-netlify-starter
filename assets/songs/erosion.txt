Erosion

Fearing time I watch the birds fall,
Sprawled out on sickening grass,
A spiralling confusion,
They call to me at last

And In the misty distance
Your shadow stands midst trees of stone 
Where I long to lay and wait
for us to be alone

(Wait there for me)

Sound out your name a thousand times,
Until it drowns in times delay  
I draw your name into the sand,
And watch the wind blow it away 

I carve your name into the stone,
In hopes to come another day,
But time moves fast and stones grow old, 
And erosion takes its place (wears it's face)
