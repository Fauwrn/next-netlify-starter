erosion

fearing time i watch the birds fall,
sprawled out on sickening grass,
a spiralling confusion,
they call to me at last

and in the misty distance
your shadow stands midst trees of stone 
where i long to lay and wait
for us to be alone

(-wait there for me-)

sound out your name a thousand times,
until it drowns in times delay  
i draw your name into the sand,
And watch the wind blow it away 

i carve your name into the stone,
in hopes to come another day,
but time moves fast and stones grow old, 
and erosion wears it's face
