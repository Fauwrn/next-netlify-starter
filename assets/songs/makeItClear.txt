make it clear

sky looks bad on a long day,
haven't seen your face since last week,
and it looks like it might rain,
and a smile might be all there is to gain
and if you said it so, at least it then would make things clear
but if you said it so, it might be things that i fear
don't know how you feel about me,
wish there's some kind of sign you'd give me,
and the rain starts to fall(pour) on my face,
and theres some kind of feeling i cant place
but please make it clearer
so please make it clearer
and if you said it so, at least it then would make things clear
but if you said it so, it might be things that i fear
