stop pretending

id like to get through to you
id like us both to stop pretending
you dont know how much it hurt
you cant tell me thats how it goes
i know you werent even listening
but i want to see
if we can stop pretending

and i cant breath
its hurting me

you say you dont belive in anything,
what would it take for you to believe in us?
believe in us.
