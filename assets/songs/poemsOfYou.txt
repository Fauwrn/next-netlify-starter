poems (of you)

if all the words i wrote came true -
all the poems i wrote for you,
i'd remove this strange attire,
masquerading false-desire

if i could lay them in a fire
and watch the flames climb ever higher,
flicker in the speckled night
punctuated lights in flight

the ash will glow
but cool to grey,
thoughts i long to drop
but cling to in confusion
knowing that im lost,
leaning on them like a branch
when roots cant keep my tired stance

do i whisper to the fire?
answer voices in the crackling pyre?

i’ll be warm here by the fire
in hope you’ll join me for a while
will i burn, or freeze in cold
as i long to turn to gold?
