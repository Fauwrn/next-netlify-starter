You stand at the crossroads, weighed down by the luggage on your back - a knapsack of supplies and a wrapped up string instrument. 
At the intersection a crow perches upon a leaning sign that stands like a forgotten gravestone.

You struggle to decipher the worn text on its pointing appendages -
It is clear that whichever path you should choose to take will not lead to clarity, but you have little choice to return from wence you came.
Shuffling on the spot, you ready yourself and make the decision

... Go left, into the twisting shadows of the deepening of the forest.

... Go right, following the crumbled stone walls that loosely line the path (towards the ruin.)
